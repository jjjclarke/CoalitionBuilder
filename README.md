# CoalitionBuilder

This was my final project for my Software Development 3.1 class. As such, this isn't really intended to be used by anyone, and it's not exactly the most efficient way of creating such a program. There's a lot of code written here purely to meet the requirements of my course.

## Building and Running

CoalitionBuilder doesn't need or use any fancy build tools, and it was developed in Eclipse. I recommend using Eclipse 2025-06 or higher, since that's the version I used most recently to test it. `Main.java` is the entry point.

You can test the program using the election data included in the `samples` directory. You can also make your own as long as they follow the pre-programmed headings of Party, Leader and Seats. The examples are pretty simple to follow.
